## 🎯 What You'll Learn

1. How to access the admin panel
2. How to upload pitch deck files
3. How to generate secure links
4. How to share files with investors
5. How to track file access

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Demo

### Step 1: Access Admin Panel

**URL:** `https://yourdomain.com/admin.html`

This will redirect you to the secure admin interface. You'll see a login screen with a lock icon.

### Step 2: Admin Login

**Password:** `TRADEFOOX_SECURE_2024`

Enter the password and click "Access Admin Panel". You'll be taken to the main dashboard.

### Step 3: Upload Files

1. **Drag & Drop**: Simply drag your pitch deck files into the upload area
2. **Click to Browse**: Or click "Select Files" to choose files manually
3. **Supported Formats**: PDF, PPT, PPTX, DOC, DOCX
4. **Upload Progress**: Watch the progress bar as files upload

**Example Files to Upload:**
- `TRADEFOOX_Series_A_Pitch_Deck.pdf`
- `Financial_Projections_2024.xlsx`

### Step 4: Manage Uploaded Files

After upload, you'll see each file listed with:
- File name and type
- Upload date and time
- File size
- Download count (starts at 0)
- Last accessed timestamp

### Step 5: Generate Secure Links

For each file, you have three action buttons:

1. **👁️ Copy Link** - Generates a secure access link
2. **⬇️ Download** - Downloads the file for testing
3. **🗑️ Delete** - Removes the file permanently

**Click "Copy Link"** to generate a secure URL for sharing.

### Step 6: Share with Investors

The generated link will look like:
```
https://dayone-mediagroup.com/pitch-deck-access/aBcDeF1234567890XyZ/pitch_1703123456789_abc123def
```

**Copy this link** and include it in your investor emails.

### Step 7: Monitor Access

Check back in the admin panel to see:
- How many times each file was downloaded
- When files were last accessed
- Track investor engagement
