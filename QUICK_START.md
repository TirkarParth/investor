# 🚀 Quick Start - Fix Access Denied Issues

## ⚡ Immediate Solution

Your users are getting "Access Denied" errors because files are stored locally in browsers instead of on your server. Here's how to fix it in 3 steps:

## 📋 What You Need

- Your ALL-INKL.COM FTP credentials (already configured)
- SSH access to your server
- Node.js support on your hosting

## 🛠️ Quick Fix (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Deploy the Secure File Server
```bash
# Set your credentials (replace with actual values)
export ALL_INKL_HOST="your-server.all-inkl.com"
export ALL_INKL_USERNAME="w00ac8e2"
export ALL_INKL_PASSWORD="your-password"

# Run deployment
./deploy-server.sh
```

### Step 2: Start the Server
```bash
# SSH into your server
ssh w00ac8e2@your-server.all-inkl.com

# Navigate to server directory
cd /www/htdocs/w00ac8e2/dayone-mediagroup.com/secure-files

# Install dependencies and start
npm install --production
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

### Step 3: Test the System
```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:3001/health

# Should return: {"status":"healthy","filesCount":0}
```

## ✅ What This Fixes

- ❌ **Before**: Files stored in browser → Only accessible to uploader
- ✅ **After**: Files stored on server → Accessible to all users with valid links

## 🔗 How It Works Now

1. **Admin uploads file** → File stored on your FTP server
2. **Secure link generated** → Unique token for each file
3. **User clicks link** → Server validates token and serves file
4. **No more access denied** → All valid links work for all users

## 🚨 If You Get Stuck

1. **Check deployment guide**: `SECURE_FILE_SERVER_DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. **Verify server is running**: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
3. **Check logs**: `tail -f logs/err.log`

## 🎯 Expected Result

After deployment, when users click your secure pitch deck links, they'll see:
- ✅ File download instead of "Access Denied"
- ✅ Professional investor experience maintained
- ✅ Secure, centralized file management
